```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## make a simple regression model

```{r}
bears <- read.csv(file="BEARS.csv",header = TRUE)
```

## Model LENGTH ~ NECK  this is an example  

```{r}
simp <- lm(LENGTH~NECK,data=bears)
plot(LENGTH~NECK,data=bears)
abline(simp)
summary.lm(simp)
```

## now predict the length of a bear who has a neck of 17, 22 and 26


```{r}
new <- data.frame(NECK=c(17,22,26))
predict(simp,new)
predict(simp,new,se.fit=TRUE)
```
## Surely there is another variable that can better predict LENGTH than NECK. Find one and compare its performance to that of neck by it value of Adjusted-Rsquared (bigger is better).

We will try to model the length of a bear based on the chest size. 

```{r}
mychest <- lm(LENGTH~CHEST,data=bears)
plot(LENGTH~CHEST,data=bears)
abline(mychest)
summary.lm(mychest)
```

Now we have two models, it appears that this (mychest) model is better than the other since the Adjusted R-Square is 0.7869 and the Residual standard error came out to be 4.939. In the first (simp) model we had an Adjusted R-Square of 0.7476 and a Residual standard error of 5.376. In comparison, the mychest model is better because it has a larger Adjusted R-square and smaller Residual standard error, this is preferred since it explains more of the variation of error. 

```{r}
myheadwth <- lm(LENGTH~HEADWTH,data=bears)
plot(LENGTH~HEADWTH,data=bears)
abline(myheadwth)
summary.lm(myheadwth)
```

In the model above, myheadwth, we can see that the Adjusted R-square went down and the Residual standard error went up. 

```{r}
myheadlen <- lm(LENGTH~HEADLEN,data=bears)
plot(LENGTH~HEADLEN,data=bears)
abline(myheadlen)
summary.lm(myheadlen)
```

In the model above, myheadlen, we can see that the Adjusted R-square went up to 0.8434 and the Residual standard error went down to 4.235. Compared to the mychest model (who was in the lead) it had an Adjusted R-Square of 0.7869 and a Residual standard error of 4.939. The myheadlen model is better than all the other models including the mychest model since the Adjusted R-square is higher and the Residual standard error is lower.
